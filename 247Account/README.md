# 247Account
A simple code that runs your Discord account 24/7

## Installation
NpmJS:
```
npm i dotenv express discord.js-selfbot-v13
```

## Setup
Alternatively, if you want to host it on your PC, simply add your token to the **.env** file **TOKEN** variable.

## Hosting
1. Create an account in Replit. https://replit.com.
2. Create a project in **NodeJS**, then drag the files from **247Account** onto the project.
3. Create an environment variable called **TOKEN** in Replit settings, then put your Discord account token there then run it.
4. Create an account on UptimeRobot. https://uptimerobot.com/
5. Add a new **site** then put the project production URL there (Make sure it pings every 5 minutes) then save it.
6. You're good to go, just leave the Replit project alone and your account should be online even If your PC is off.

## Usage
```
node index.js
```
